This project dives deep into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The idea of this project is to keep a record of cars in a dealership and if 
a user wishes to proceed with a car purchase, the program will undergo common
car purchasing practices. Use of OOP is persistent. The class, CarDealership has 
all the attributes of a car and methods which will be used to let the user make 
a car purchase. Both of the classes work together to complete the task in a formal
yet aesthetic look.
